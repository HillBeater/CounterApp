Overview

The Counter App is a simple Kotlin application designed to help users increment and decrement a counter. This project showcases the use of the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture to maintain state across device rotations, ensuring a seamless user experience.

Features
1. Increment and decrement counter functionality.
2. Persistent counter value across device rotations using MVVM architecture.
3. Clean and intuitive user interface.
   
Technologies Used
1. Kotlin: The primary language for Android app development.
2. MVVM Architecture: Ensures separation of concerns, making the app more modular, testable, and maintainable.
3. Jetpack Libraries: Utilized for ViewModel and LiveData to handle UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way.
